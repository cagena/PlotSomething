# Term Project Proposal

## Description

Our pen plotter project will use a cylindrical axis system, which involves a radial arm that rotates around a hub and a lead screw that moves the pen 
radially.One motor that will rotate the radial arm and another motor will rotate the lead screw. We will attach the nut in the lead screw to the pen using 
a 3D printed part. The nut in the lead screw will ideally be translating linearly. To ensure that the pen connected to the nut will not be rotating at all, 
we will  be incorporating a slider mechanism above the lead screw and attach the corresponding moving piece to the pen as well. We plan to 3D print a mount 
to keep both motors at the origin (which we will define as the top-middle position of the paper).
