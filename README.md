# Term Project Proposal

A description of your proposed system. This should be one or two paragraphs.
Our pen plotter system will use radial and angular axes, which involve a radial arm that rotates around a hub and a lead screw that moves the pen radially.
We will have one motor that will rotate the radial arm and another motor that will rotate the lead screw. We will attach the nut in the lead screw to the
