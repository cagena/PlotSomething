Introduction</h1>
<p >The term project is to design and build a 2.5 degree of freedom pen plotter. The plotter was designed, built, and codedwithin a 3 week period. The code will be explained here.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="software"></a>
Software Design</h1>
<p >Throughout the quarter, software was developed for motion control, multitasking, and program organization.There are 8 distinct .py files used for the control of the pen plotter. The <a class="el" href="main_8py.html" title="This is the main file for Lab 3, it contains a program that runs two motor tasks which includes close...">main.py</a> file consists of the different task generators and a main function portion. The tasks include two motor tasks, a user task, and a input task. The main program initializes the drivers and runs the task manager that allows multitasking. The drivers operate hardware including the motor and encoder; and also do some stand alone processing in the form of a closed loop controller and hpgl file reader. More detail on the driver files can be found at <a class="el" href="motor__agena__chiu_8py.html" title="This is the file that serves as a module to be imported in main.">motor_agena_chiu.py</a>, <a class="el" href="encoder__agena__chiu_8py.html" title="This is the file that serves as a module to be imported in main.">encoder_agena_chiu.py</a>, <a class="el" href="controller__agena__chiu_8py.html" title="This is the file that serves as a module to be imported in main.">controller_agena_chiu.py</a>, and <a class="el" href="hpgl__agena__chiu_8py.html" title="This is the file that serves as a module to be imported in main.">hpgl_agena_chiu.py</a>. The final three files were provided by Dr. Ridgely. They are the <a class="el" href="cotask_8py.html" title="This file contains classes to run cooperatively scheduled tasks in a multitasking system.">cotask.py</a>, <a class="el" href="task__share_8py.html" title="This file contains classes which allow tasks to share data without the risk of data corruption by int...">task_share.py</a>, and <a class="el" href="nb__input_8py.html" title="This file contains a class which can be used to read input through a serial port in a non-blocking wa...">nb_input.py</a>. The cotask file allows for multitasking, the task share file allows the use of shares and queues across tasks, and the nb_input allows the reading of the serial port using non-blocking methods. The software was outlined in the form of a task diagram and multiple state transition diagrams shown below.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="task"></a>
Task Diagram</h2>
<p >The task diagram below shows how the tasks were implemented with the use of a single share. The rest of the communication was completed using drivers. There was a bug in the communication, that can be solved with the implementation of a queue for each motor. Data allocation errors were apparent and an issue with adding non-integer values caused attempt at different methods. After reworking this task diagram it is apparent that in the attempt to fix the errors and simplify the code the functionality and required components were lost. This means that with some extra time, work, and the implementation of queues the final bug could be resolved. </p><div class="image">

<h2><a class="anchor" id="user"></a>
User Task</h2>
<p >The user task is run on the microcontroller and it leads the user through the proper use of the pen plotter. It starts with calibration, moving the pen to its zero point along the radial direction. Then it prints the help screen with the different commands that can be input to the serial port. Depending on the command the help window will be printed again, the entire program will quit, or it will continue to the read state. The read state is where the hpgl file is opened and read from using the hpgl driver. Once the file is found and read from then the program transitions to the plot state. This is where the pen plotter is controlled toward the positions read from the hpgl file. The current software structure runs one location at a time, requiring a counter input into the driver to keep track of which position has already been sent to the plotter. </p><div class="image">

<h2><a class="anchor" id="motor"></a>
Motor Task</h2>
<p >The motor task has been simplified greatly. It handles the actuation of the motors, reading from the encoders, and controlling the motors with a closed loop controller. However, all of this continuously happens and does not require input until a new setpoint is provided. So there are two states: set duty and control. The finite state machine starts at set duty if the duty is not changed then it is considered 0 and the motors are not actuated. If a setpoint is entered then a new duty cycle will be calculated as a result and the motors will acuate. When this happens the program enters the control state where the controller will approach the setpoint and raise a flag when the encoders read within the specified tolerances. When the flag is raised then the program waits for another setpoint and duty cycle. </p><div class="image">

<h2><a class="anchor" id="other"></a>
Other Features</h2>
<p >Other features include the solenoid, limit switch, and hpgl driver. The solenoid is connected to a analog pin that is initialized then set high or low. Since the position is remembered a task is not required for this piece of hardware. The limit switch was used in the calibration state of the user task, where the motor is actuated until the limit switch is hit and sets that point to zero. The limit switch is connected to a analog pin that is initialized and read from using the pyb.adc module and stoping the motor when that value decreased below a set value of 5. Finally the hpgl driver reads the file and processes the information multiple times to get them in the proper units and scaled to fit the geometry and mechanics of the physical system.</p>
